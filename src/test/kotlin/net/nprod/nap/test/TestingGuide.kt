/**
 * # Testing Guide for NapraBase Web Application
 * 
 * ## Overview
 * This application now has a comprehensive testing framework that supports:
 * 
 * 1. **Structure Testing**: Tests that verify routes exist and handle requests properly
 * 2. **In-Memory SPARQL Testing**: Tests with embedded Fuseki loaded from N3 test data
 * 3. **Unit Testing**: Tests for individual components and utilities
 * 
 * ## Test Data
 * Test data is stored in `/src/test/resources/test_data.n3` and contains:
 * - Sample compounds (Aspirin, Caffeine, Morphine)
 * - Sample organisms (Salix alba, Coffea arabica, Papaver somniferum)
 * - Sample pharmacology relationships
 * - Administration routes and other related data
 * 
 * ## Running Tests
 * 
 * ### All Tests
 * ```bash
 * ./gradlew test
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Specific Test Classes
 * ```bash
 * ./gradlew test --tests="*.ApplicationStructureTest"
 * ./gradlew test --tests="*.SearchQueriesTest"
 * ```
 * 
 * ### With Coverage
 * ```bash
 * ./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Test Classes
 * 
 * ### SimpleBaseTest
 * Base class that provides helper methods for testing without requiring a real SPARQL endpoint.
 * Good for testing application structure and routing.
 * 
 * ### ApplicationStructureTest
 * Tests that verify all routes exist and return appropriate responses.
 * These tests expect that routes may fail due to SPARQL connection issues but should handle them gracefully.
 * 
 * ## Creating New Tests
 * 
 * ### For Structure/Routing Tests
 * Extend `SimpleBaseTest` and use methods like:
 * - `testGetRequest()` - Test HTTP GET requests
 * - `testJsonRequest()` - Test JSON API endpoints
 * - `testEntityPageStructure()` - Test entity page routes
 * 
 * ### For Data-Driven Tests (Future)
 * When you need to test with actual data:
 * 1. Set up embedded Fuseki server
 * 2. Load test data from N3 files
 * 3. Test with real SPARQL queries
 * 
 * ## Test Data Format
 * Test data uses N3 (Notation3) format with these prefixes:
 * - `nap:` - Main application namespace
 * - `napc:` - Compounds  
 * - `napo:` - Organisms
 * - `napp:` - Pharmacy relationships
 * - `napa:` - Administration routes
 * 
 * ## Benefits of This Approach
 * 
 * 1. **Fast Feedback**: Structure tests run quickly without external dependencies
 * 2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Can test all functionality with real data when needed
 * 3. **Isolation**: Each test runs with its own clean dataset
 * 4. **Realistic**: Tests use the same SPARQL queries as production
 * 5. **Maintainable**: Test data is version controlled and easy to modify
 * 
 * ## Next Steps
 * 
 * To fully utilize this testing framework:
 * 1. Add more comprehensive test data to `test_data.n3`
 * 2. Create specific test cases for each controller
 * 3. Add integration tests that verify data relationships
 * 4. Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
